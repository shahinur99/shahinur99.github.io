                This website was divided into two main parts. One part
                  is for the sailor and ship owner and another part is for the admin panel. Users in the sailor and ship
                  owner section can access real-time data about their vessel position, speed, course,
                  and whether there are any other boats in front of them. An
                  interactive map offers where they also see the other vessel’s
                  location. Meanwhile, the admin panel section will be able to
                  view and know all the boat’s location and other information.
                  Besides, the website will indicate if there is an overload
                  problem, if there is a possibility of collusion, and if there
                  is a fire.
